**This is the branch-specific readme; check readme.txt for Ares's readme.**

Intro
=====
This is the Ares release package repository. The purpose of this repository is to provide current, release-ready versions of all auxiliary files of an Ares distribution package, to allow both quick manual as well as automatic composition of such release packages.

Contents
========
This repository should, at all times, contain the latest public versions of the following items:
* readme.txt
* ares.mix
* a version of Ares's license text
* a complete version of the manual
This list is not intended to limit what can be in this repository, it should be taken as a minimum.

What should *not* be in this repository is:
* Ares.dll
* Ares.dll.inj
* Ares.pdb
* Syringe.exe
* Syringe's license
These are files that are managed elsewhere.

How to create an Ares Standalone Package
========================================
Thanks to this repository, creating a custom Ares package is rather simple:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Insert your Ares.dll and Ares.dll.inj.
3. Insert Syringe.exe and Syringe's license.
4. Remove the .git folder and the README file (*this* file, **not** readme.txt).
5. Put the folder contents into an archive.
...and that's it! That's all there is to it. There are really only three parts to combine: This repository, the Ares binary/injection files, and Syringe.

Custom releases
===============
**Be advised:** If you create an Ares Standalone Package with a customized version of Ares, you **must** make explicit and obvious that the package you're distributing is **not** an official Ares release by the Ares Developers.
Falsely implying your custom release is official violates the license and thus terminates your right to distribute your custom version.
