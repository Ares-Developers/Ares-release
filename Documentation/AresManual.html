	Documentation documentation:
	We're abusing two HTML elements to auto-generate the manual's lists:
	
	<var class="file section type default">TagName=</var>
	Example: <var class="rules SuperWeapon integer xxxnum5">Cursor.Interval=</var>
	This would generate the entry for Cursor.Interval= in section [SuperWeapon] of type integer with default 6, under the rulesmd.ini flags in Appendix A - New Flags/Sections.
	We're parsing three special values: xxxnum, xxxperc and R_G_B; this is necessary because CSS classes can't start with numbers, and commas are CSS operators
		xxxnum just vanishes
		xxxperc appends a percentage sign to the number
		R_G_B is turned into R,G,B
		Center_Middle is turned into Center,Middle
		foo____bar is turned into [foo]>bar (those are four underscores)
	If you need spaces, use underscores instead (e.g. list_of_InfantryTypes); there is a special exception for SpyPlane_Approach. Try not to be verbose, and not to use special characters.
	
	<dfn class="kind of change/addition">Description</dfn>
	Example: <dfn class="bugfix">Prism support modifier fixed for game modes/maps.</dfn>
	This would generate a feature explanation listing for Prism support modifiers in the bugfix section of Appendix B – Ares Feature Summary.
	We're accepting:
		bugfix -> this is a bugfix
		restored -> this was restored from Tiberian Sun
		new -> this is a new feature, added by Ares
	The explanations are sorted into the the respective lists in Appendix B.
	In addition, the value "inset" can be added, to bump the explanation into a "sub-list" generated by adding 2em margin to the left.

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p><span class="gamename">Ares</span> is the new tool to extend the capabilities of <span class="gamename">Yuri's Revenge</span>. It was conceived by pd near the end of 2007, and is currently in an early development and testing cycle.</p>
	<p>This documentation is aimed primarily at <span class="gamename">Ares</span> testers, as <span class="gamename">Ares</span> is a work in progress and subject to many further changes. However, the documentation is also aimed at mod authors wishing to make use of the new functionality that <span class="gamename">Ares</span> offers.</p>
	<p><span class="gamename">Ares</span> is incorporated into <span class="gamename">Yuri's Revenge</span> via the use of <span class="gamename">Syringe</span>, a program developed by pd to 'inject' DLL code into a running executable without modifying the executable itself. In this case, the <span class="gamename">Ares</span> DLL is injected into the <span class="gamename">Yuri's Revenge 1.001</span> main executable, <span class="filename">gamemd.exe</span>.</p>
	<p><span class="gamename">Syringe</span> can be run directly via a command line prompt, or automatically using <span class="gamename">Launch Base</span>. See the respective documentations of those programs for further details.</p>
	<div style="clear:both;"> </div>

	<h3>Compatibility Notes</h3>
	<h4><span class="gamename">RockPatch/NPatch</span></h4>
	<p><span class="gamename">Ares</span> is not intended to be used in conjunction with any third party patch that modifies the executable of the game. This is due to fairly obvious technical reasons that were best summarized by Renegade: [paraphrase] <q cite="Renegade">You can't use the USA maps on your GPS to navigate through Russia.</q><br>
	...because sooner or later you will drive down a road that doesn't exist, and off a cliff.</p>
	<h4><span class="gamename">Comodo Internet Security</span></h4>
	<p>Comodo has been reported as being a problem multiple times.  It seems that this particular program has a strong dislike for programs that alter other programs.  Normally, this is a good thing, but Ares works with a program called <span class="gamename">Syringe</span>, which is a program that alters other programs.  Be advised that issues may be encountered.  A solution can be found <a href="http://forums.renegadeprojects.com/showthread.php?tid=1714&page=2">here</a>.</p>

	

	<h3>Known Major Issues</h3>
		<li><h4>Save Games</h4></li>
		<p>For the same reasons, <span class="gamename">Ares</span> does not support loading save games or scripted IPB videos that were created with any other version of the game than the very same version of <span class="gamename">Ares</span> (not even the original <span class="gamename">Yuri's Revenge</span> save games are supported).<br>
		<span class="note">NB: Unfortunately, for the moment, save games are not functional at all in <span class="gamename">Ares</span>. This is a known problem that will be fixed in the future - <span class="gamename">Ares</span> will eventually be able to load games that were saved using [the exact same version of] <span 	class="gamename">Ares</span>.</span></p>
		<p><span class="note">NB:  As of July 2011, this issue has been targeted to 1.0 due to its complexity and lack of interest in the issue.</span></p>
	
	<h3>Known Minor Issues</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The <code>SolidHeight</code>/Solid Buildings functionality does not work with invisible projectiles yet. (<a href="http://bugs.renegadeprojects.com/view.php?id=888">Issue #888</a>)</li>
		<h4>The Whiteboy Bug</h4>
		<li>There remains an upper limit, 74, on the number of units that can be displayed per construction tab on the UI bar.  Going over this results in a frozen game.(<a href="http://bugs.renegadeprojects.com/view.php?id=1416">Issue #1416)</a></li>
	
	</ul>

	<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
	<p><span class="gamename">Ares</span> provides three types of bug fixes:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Fixes to genuine bugs in the original, unmodded <span class="gamename">Yuri's Revenge 1.001</span>, which cannot be fixed simply by modifying INI files or graphics (like the <span class="gamename">UMP</span> does).</li>
	<li>Fixes to logic that goes unused in the unmodded game, or at least not used to its full capabilities &ndash; i.e. game logic that often does not work as expected when used in mods.<br>
	<em>[This section might have included logic that existed in <span class="gamename">Tiberian Sun</span> but was removed by <span class="gamename">Yuri's Revenge 1.001</span>, however we have dedicated a <a href="#RestoredTiberianSunLogic">whole separate chapter</a> to restored <span class="gamename">Tiberian Sun</span> logic.]</em></li>
	<li>Corrections and enhancements to code efficiency that reduce loading times and in-game lag without affecting gameplay mechanics. Also hardware/operating system related crashes.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Type 1 Fixes (Original Bugs)</h3>
	
	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Temporal Warheads Earn Experience By Killing Friendly Units</h4>
		<p>When a unit kills an enemy unit it gains experience, which can lead to that unit becoming veteran or elite. Killing friendly units (your own or your allies') does not earn experience in this way.<br>
		However, <em>Temporal</em> warheads (warheads with <code>Temporal=yes</code> set) <em>did</em> use to earn experience when killing friendly units. This is no longer the case. <dfn class="bugfix">Temporal warheads no longer gain experience when used against allies</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares02">
		<h4>Prism Support Bugs</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Whenever a game mode or map declared the <code>[General]</code> section without re-stating the <code>PrismSupportModifier</code>, the <code>PrismSupportModifier</code> from <span class="filename">rulesmd.ini</span> would get multiplied by 100, thus causing supported Prism Towers to deal extremely high damage. This bug is now fixed. It should be noted that several official maps which used to exhibit this bug were already 'fixed' by the <span class="gamename">UMP</span> by re-stating <code>PrismSupportModifier=150%</code> in each affected map. As a result of the <span class="gamename">UMP</span> fixes, these maps are now set at the original 150%, regardless of what your mod may set it to. If you want to change this then you should manually override the global modifier via <span class="gamename">Ares</span>' new Prism Forwarding logic. This can be done simply by adding a single flag to the Prism Tower:<br>
				<code>[ATESLA]&#9658;PrismForwarding.SupportModifier=whatever</code>
				<dfn class="bugfix">Prism support modifier fixed for game modes/maps.</dfn>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Once a Prism Tower had decided to support another, the firing tower gained that tower's benefit. If the supporting tower was destroyed or otherwise incapacitated, the firing tower would still get the full benefit of that tower, even though there are no visual effects drawn (and the supporting tower may even have started supporting another). <span class="gamename">Ares</span> fixes this so that incapacitated supporting towers do not contribute to the firing tower.
				<dfn class="bugfix">Lost prism supports no longer contribute to the firing beam.</dfn>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Prism Towers could be made to support another during their construction or selling phases. This caused graphical glitches with the tower. <span class="gamename">Ares</span> prevents these towers from supporting others.
				<dfn class="bugfix">Constructing/selling Prism Towers are no longer eligible to be support towers.</dfn>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.2</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Frozen Mutation (MakeInfantry) Animations</h4>
		<p>Infantry killed by a mutation warhead appear to transform into another InfantryType. Internally this is achieved by playing an animation, upon completion of which a new infantry unit is spawned. If the cell where the new infantry is to be spawned is already occupied then the animation will pause on the final frame until the obstacle is cleared. The original game would allocate memory for the new infantry on every frame but would fail to de-allocate that memory when the infantry could not be placed. The more time that passes with the animation in this state, the worse the memory leak gets &ndash; resulting in the game eventually grinding to a halt. <span class="gamename">Ares</span> fixes this by simply deleting the animation if the new infantry unit cannot be spawned.<dfn class="bugfix">Stuck mutation animations are deleted (thus preventing a memory leak)</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Misleading Veteran Naval Cameos</h4>
		<p>When you infiltrate an enemy War Factory, any [trainable] VehicleTypes' (not AircraftTypes) cameos (build icons) will gain the veteran symbol, indicating that they will start veteran when built. However, only vehicles built from a War Factory will actually start veteran, not vehicles built from a Naval Yard. <span class="gamename">Ares</span> ensures that only the vehicles that will actually start veteran gain the veteran symbol for their cameos.<dfn class="bugfix">Spying a war factory will not give you veteran build icons for naval units incorrectly.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Secret Lab Boon Weighting</h4>
		<p>The random weighting of each possible Secret Lab boon was not calculated correctly &ndash; the later a boon appeared in the list the less likely it was to appear in-game. For example, if the Grand Cannon were not picked as the boon for the first Secret Lab on the map (probability 1/8) then it could not be picked for any of the other Secret Labs. This has been fixed such that every Secret Lab will pick its boon completely at random, independently of other Secret Labs on the map.<dfn class="bugfix">Secret lab boons are picked truly at random.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Too Many Secret Labs</h4>
		<p>If there were more Secret Labs on the map than there were possible boons then all of the Secret Labs would be 'empty'. This has been fixed such that every Secret Lab will pick its boon completely at random, independently of other Secret Labs on the map.<dfn class="bugfix">Too many secret labs on a map would cause them all to be empty. Not anymore.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>AI Targeting Cloaked Objects With Major Super Weapons</h4>
		<p>When AI controlled Super weapons with <code>Type=WeatherStorm</code> or <code>Type=Nuke</code> picked their target, they failed to ignore cloaked objects (such as Submarines) and, as a result, sometimes selected them as targets, ruining the appearance of fair play. Cloaked objects are no longer considered as targets for these super weapons.<dfn class="bugfix">AI will not use weather storms or nukes on cloaked units.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Enemy Harvester Guard Mode Exploit</h4>
		<p>It was possible to issue the 'guard mode' order to enemy harvesters as if they were your own units. Players unaware of this exploit would find their economy crippled when facing an unscrupulous player. It is no longer possible to issue the guard mode order to enemy harvesters.<dfn class="bugfix">"Enemy harvester guard mode" exploit no longer works.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Parasites In Airborne Units</h4>
		<p>If a parasite (e.g. Terror Drone) entered a unit that can fly (e.g. Nighthawk) and that unit was destroyed by the parasite whilst airborne then the parasite would appear, unscathed, on the ground beneath the destroyed unit. In <span class="gamename">Ares</span>, the parasite will instead appear at the same height as the destroyed airborne unit and fall to the ground - where it will be destroyed by the impact.<dfn class="bugfix">Parasites that destroy an airborne unit will fall to the ground and be destroyed too.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Warhead Verses' Special Values</h4>
		<p>The <code>Verses</code> flag (which is used on warheads to manipulate the damage dealt versus different armor types) has three special-case values used to define additional behavior:</p>
		<ul class="nobullets">
			<li>0% means no force fire, no retaliate, no passive acquire</li>
			<li>1% means no retaliate, no passive acquire</li>
			<li>2% means no passive acquire</li>
		</ul>
		<p>However, a bug with the way the floating-point values are compared means that these behaviors were not always applied consistently. <span class="gamename">Ares</span> fixes this bug so the behavior should always be consistent now.<br>
		The special behaviors can also now be toggled independently of the Verses value (see <a href="#AdditionalArmorTypesandVerses">Additional ArmorTypes and Verses</a>).<dfn class="bugfix">Warhead verses special values (0%/1%/2%) should now apply their behavior consistently.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Unit Sounds Played At Inappropriate Times</h4>
		<p>When a unit was pulled by a Magnetron it would play its <code>MoveSound</code>, even though it was not moving under its own power. Now, this sound will only be played when the unit moves under its own power.<dfn class="bugfix">Units pulled by a Magnetron will on longer play their move sound.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares02">
		<h4>Load Screen Colors</h4>
		<p>Westwood did not update the code that selects the load screen text color for <span class="gamename">Yuri's Revenge</span>. The original campaigns always used red no matter what faction you played as. For the multiplayer game modes, everything that was not Allied got red, too. <span class="gamename">Ares</span> selects these values: Allies get blue for campaigns and Yuri gets purple in multiplayer.<dfn class="bugfix">Dedicated load screen text colors for each faction.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.2</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares02">
		<h4>Animated Super Weapon Cursor</h4>
		<p>Several super weapon cursors contain multiple frames but only display the first one. <span class="gamename">Ares</span> enables these animations for the paradrop, chronoshift and iron curtain cursors.<dfn class="bugfix">Several super weapon cursor animations enabled.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.2</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares02">
		<h4>Chronoshift Will Sink Jumpjet Units</h4>
		<p>If a jumpjet unit with <code>SpeedType=Hover</code> like the Nighthawk or the deployed Siege Chopper was chronoshifted into water it originally would not sink. The unit would even be able to take off unharmed. <span class="gamename">Ares</span> will let these jumpjet units sink.<dfn class="bugfix">Jumpjet units will sink when chronoshifted into water.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.2</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares02">
		<h4>Temporal Warheads and Potential Occupation Targets</h4>
		<p>If a player ordered infantry to occupy a neutral structure, and the building was erased with a Temporal warhead before the potential occupiers could arrive, an Internal Error would occur. <span class="gamename">Ares</span> fixes this behavior so that erasing the structure will no longer trigger an error.<dfn class="bugfix">Temporal Warheads and potential occupation targets.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.2</span></p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="ares02">
		<h4>Firing Voices and Veterancy</h4>
		<p><span class="gamename">Yuri's Revenge</span> uses different unit voice lists for firing weapons (<code>VoicePrimaryWeaponAttack</code>, <code>VoicePrimaryEliteWeaponAttack</code>, <code>VoiceSecondaryWeaponAttack</code> and <code>VoiceSecondaryEliteWeaponAttack</code>). If the <code>*EliteWeaponAttack</code> list is empty, <code>VoiceAttack</code> is used instead of the more appropriate non-elite version <code>*WeaponAttack</code>. This behavior makes units like Boris, Magnetrons, Siege Choppers, Boomers and Floating Discs lose their special voices once they become elite. <span class="gamename">Ares</span> falls back to the non-elite weapon firing voices instead of using the generic <code>VoiceAttack</code> ones.</p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.2</span></p><dfn class="bugfix">Units won't lose their special weapon firing voices once they become elite.</dfn>
	</div>

	<h3>Type 2 Fixes (Mod Logics)</h3>
	
	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Unit Sounds Played At Inappropriate Times</h4>
		<p>When an <span class="type">InfantryType</span> with <code>MovementZone=AmphibiousDestroyer</code> was carried between water and land inside an 'open topped' vehicle (e.g. a Nighthawk converted into a flying Battle Fortress), their <code>EnterWaterSound</code>/<code>ExitWaterSound</code> would be played. Now, these sounds will only be played when the <span class="type">InfantryType</span> themselves physically enters/leaves water.</p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Buildable Secret Labs</h4>
		<p>Secret Lab boons were picked on map load so if a Secret Lab were not pre-placed on the map then it would not provide a boon. With <span class="gamename">Ares</span>, Secret Labs constructed by a player will randomly pick a boon that that player could not build at the time the Secret Lab was placed.<dfn class="bugfix">Buildable secret labs will now have a boon.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Buildable Construction Yards</h4>
		<p>Construction Yards that were made buildable from the sidebar would cause an Internal Error if the player started construction of one and then cancelled it. This error no longer occurs.<dfn class="bugfix">Buildable construction yards no longer cause an IE when canceled.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Animation Damage Warheads</h4>
		<p>Animations may have appeared to deal damage randomly rather than based on the warhead specified. In fact, animations were hard-coded to deal damage using the warhead specified by <code>[CombatDamage]&#9658;FlameDamage2</code>, unless the animation ID was <code>[INVISO]</code>, in which case the warhead used was <code>[CombatDamage]&#9658;C4Warhead</code>. With <span class="gamename">Ares</span>, the <code>[Animation]&#9658;Warhead=</code> flag will be adhered to, with the aforementioned warheads used as the default if <code>[Animation]&#9658;Warhead</code> is not specified.<dfn class="bugfix">Animations' warhead flag now works.</dfn><var class="art Animation warhead">Warhead=</var></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Initial Veteran Cameos</h4>
		<p>When you infiltrate, say, an enemy Barracks, any [trainable] infantry that you subsequently build will start veteran. The infantry's cameos (build icons) will gain the veteran symbol to indicate this. However, if the country you are playing as has any units that always 'start veteran' then those units did not gain the veteran symbol for their cameos. Now they do.<dfn class="bugfix">Units that start veteran as a country-specific bonus will now have veteran build icons.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">
		<h4>Units overpowering buildings</h4>
		<p>Tesla Troopers, for example, can overpower Tesla Coils to make them fire a more powerful weapon. If the same logic were applied to vehicles (for example, the Tesla Tank), to make them overpower buildings in the same way, then the overpowering weapon of the vehicle would fire but would not, in fact, overpower the building. Now vehicles can overpower buildings properly.<dfn class="bugfix">Vehicles can overpower buildings.</dfn></p>
		<p><span class="introvers">Introduced in version: 0.1</span></p>
	</div>

	<div class="ares01">

		<h4>Custom Palettes</h4>
		<p>The original game supports custom palettes on TechnoTypes using <code>Palette=</code> (filename, excluding .pal extension) on the TechnoType's entry in <span class="filename">artmd.ini</span>. However, the game would crash (with the message "You have violated the limit of having only one extra building Palette" in the (non-existent) log file) if you used the <code>Palette</code> flag more than once.

This "magic" DLL forces DirectDraw into software emulation mode, which doesn't use any hardware accelerated GPU functionality.

	<h2>Restored <span class="gamename">Tiberian Sun</span> Logic</h2>
	<p>The <span class="gamename">Yuri's Revenge</span> engine is based on the <span class="gamename">Red Alert 2</span> engine, which, in turn, is based on the <span class="gamename">Tiberian Sun</span> engine.<br>
	Various features that existed in <span class="gamename">Tiberian Sun</span> were removed in <span class="gamename">Red Alert 2</span>, and further features were removed in <span class="gamename">Yuri's Revenge</span> and in the 1.001 patch.<br>
	The extent to which these features no longer exist in <span class="gamename">Yuri's Revenge 1.001</span> varies, from not functioning correctly to complete removal of the logic (sometimes because simply using the logic causes an Internal Error).<br>
	Below is a list of the features that <span class="gamename">Ares</span> has restored, along with any changes or enhancements to the way those features used to work in <span class="gamename">Tiberian Sun</span>.<br>
	Note that, in many cases, <span class="gamename">Ares</span> has drastically changed the way these features are implemented.</p>

		<h3>EMP</h3>
		<p>Vehicles affected by EMP (Electromagnetic Pulse) are paralyzed in a similar manner to a Chrono Legionnaire erasing a unit. Unlike the Chrono Legionnaire however, EMP'd vehicles can still be attacked by other units.<br>
		EMP paralysis affects units and buildings in various ways (given they are not immune to EMP, see below):<dfn class="restored">EMP weapons</dfn><p>
		<ul>
			<li>Primary effect: units will not respond to any commands. They will stop moving and will not attack anything.</li>
			<li>Hovering units (such as the Robot Tank) will land.</li>
			<li>Units display the animation specified by <code>[General]&#9658;EMPulseSparkles=EMP_FX01</code>. Note that the <span class="filename">emp_fx01.shp</span> file that comes with Red Alert 2 is in the Tiberian Sun palette and needs to be converted.</li>
			<li>Voxel-based units are darkened (SHP-based units are not).</li>
			<li>Buildings that can undeploy into vehicles (e.g. MCVs) still can, but the resulting vehicle will remain EMP'd until the effect wears off.</li>
			<li>Aircraft will immediately crash.</li>
			<li>Power plants cease to produce power.</li>
			<li>Factories will stop working.</li>
			<li>Base defenses will not be able to fire their weapon.</li>
			<li>Gap Generators will stop emitting radar gap.</li>
			<li>Laser Fence Posts will stop emitting laser fences.</li>
			<li>Robot Control Centers will stop working.</li>
			<li>Super weapon buildings will shut down and the super weapons themselves will stop charging, <i>if</i> they have <code>[SuperWeapon]&#9658;IsPowered=yes</code> set.</li>
			<li>Radar buildings will stop providing radar.</li>
			<li>SpySat buildings will stop to reveal the map.</li>
			<li>Units that spawn other units will cease to do so. If the spawner unit has launched any aircraft then the aircraft will immediately crash.</li>
			<li>Slave Miner slaves will stop working.</li>
			<li>Units that are in their unloading state (such as ore harvesters depositing ore or Siege Choppers transforming) will only become EMP'd once they have finished unloading.</li>
			<li>Harvesters that were in the middle of harvesting when hit by EMP will resume harvesting after EMP wears off.</li>

	  	<p><span class="quick">Quickstart: If you want a warhead to EMP a target for ten seconds, set <tt>EMP.Duration=150</tt> on the warhead.</span></p>
		<p><span class="note">NB: <span class="gamename">Tiberian Sun</span> used the weapon's Damage flag to determine how long the EMP effect would last. <span class="gamename">Ares</span>, however, uses 2 new flags (EMP.Duration and EMP.Cap) to provide greater control. The weapon's Damage will be delivered independently from EMP paralysis (so a weapon can both damage and paralyze its target). <span class="gamename">Tiberian Sun</span> also used the flag EMEffect=yes, which is not used in <span class="gamename">Ares</span>.</span></p>
		<dl class="flaglist">
			<dt>[Warhead]&#9658;EMP.Duration= (integer &ndash; frames)<br>
			[Warhead]&#9658;EMP.Cap= (integer &ndash; frames)</dt>
			<dd>The above two flags are used together to determine how long (in frames) the affected units will be EMP'd for.<var class="rules Warhead integer_-_frames xxxnum0">EMP.Duration=</var><var class="rules Warhead integer_-_frames xxxnum-1">EMP.Cap=</var></dd>
		</dl>
		<p>The game keeps track of how much longer each unit will remain paralyzed. Each unit essentially has a hidden EMP counter that counts down frame by frame until it reaches zero, at which point the unit will be re-activated. This counter is what gets modified by EMP warheads.</p>
		<p>A unit does not get affected by EMP if <code>Verses</code> is equal to <code>0%</code>, otherwise the target is endowed with the full effect.</p>
		<p>First we will look at positive EMP.Duration &ndash; the targets are going to be paralyzed.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>EMP.Cap</code> is greater than zero.<br>
			Makes this EMP effect stackable, but capped.<br>
			The target's EMP counter is increased by <code>EMP.Duration</code> up to but not exceeding <code>EMP.Cap</code>.<br>
			If the target's EMP counter is already greater than <code>EMP.Cap</code> (e.g. caused by some other EMP weapon) then it will not be reduced.<br>
			Examples:<br>
			EMP counter is 0, <code>EMP.Duration=10</code>, <code>EMP.Cap=20</code>. Result: EMP counter will be set to 10.<br>
			EMP counter is 15, <code>EMP.Duration=10</code>, <code>EMP.Cap=20</code>. Result: EMP counter will be set to 20.<br>
			EMP counter is 60, <code>EMP.Duration=10</code>, <code>EMP.Cap=20</code>. EMP counter will remain at 60.</li>
			<li><code>EMP.Cap=0</code><br>
			Makes this EMP effect stackable, but uncapped.<br>
			The target's EMP counter is incremented by <code>EMP.Duration</code>, without limit.<br>
			This is <span class="gamename">Ares</span> legacy behavior (before the <code>EMP.Cap</code> flag was added).<br>
			Example:<br>
			EMP counter is 25, <code>EMP.Duration=10</code>. Result: EMP counter will be set to 35.</li>
			<li><code>EMP.Cap=-1</code><br>
			The target's EMP counter is set to the exact number of frames specified by <code>EMP.Duration</code>, unless the target's EMP counter is already greater than this.<br>
			Examples:<br>
			EMP counter is 5, <code>EMP.Duration=10</code>. Result: EMP counter will be set to 10.<br>
			EMP counter is 20, <code>EMP.Duration=10</code>. EMP counter will remain at 20.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Next we will look at negative <code>EMP.Duration</code> &ndash; for example, a friendly unit trying to re-activate the already-paralyzed unit.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>EMP.Cap=-1</code><br>
			The target's EMP counter is reduced by the number of frames specified by <code>EMP.Duration</code>.<br>
			Examples:<br>
			EMP counter is 50, <code>EMP.Duration=10</code>. Result: EMP counter will be set to 40.<br>
			EMP counter is 7, <code>EMP.Duration=10</code>. Result: EMP counter will be set to zero and the unit will re-activate.</li>
			<li><code>EMP.Cap</code> is greater than zero.<br>
			The target's EMP counter is reduced by the number of frames specified by <code>EMP.Duration</code>. If this value is still greater than <code>EMP.Cap</code> then the EMP counter is reduced further so that it is equal to <code>EMP.Cap</code>.<br>
			Examples:<br>
			EMP counter is 50, <code>EMP.Duration=10</code>, <code>EMP.Cap=70</code>. Result: EMP counter will be set to 40.<br>
			EMP counter is 50, <code>EMP.Duration=10</code>, <code>EMP.Cap=20</code>. Result: EMP counter will be set to 20.<br>
			EMP counter is 7, <code>EMP.Duration=10</code>. Result: EMP counter will be set to zero and the unit will re-activate.</li>
			<li><code>EMP.Cap=0</code><br>
			<code>EMP.Duration</code> is irrelevant. The EMP counter will be set to zero and the unit will re-activate.</li>

		<h3>Additional ArmorTypes and Verses</h3>
		<p>The new <code>[ArmorTypes]</code> section can be used to define new ArmorTypes for objects (in addition to the 11 existing ArmorTypes; none, flak, plate, light, medium, heavy, wood, steel, concrete, special_1 and special_2).</p>
		<pre>[ArmorTypes]
		paper=steel
		magic=11%</pre>

		<p><code>paper=steel</code> declares a new ArmorType called "paper" whose <code>Verses</code> on each warhead defaults to being the same as that warhead's <code>Verses</code> against the "steel" ArmorType.
		<code>magic=11%</code> declares a new ArmorType called "magic" whose <code>Verses</code> on all warheads defaults to 11%.<br>
		These ArmorTypes can be assigned to objects in the same way as the standard ArmorTypes (case-insensitively). Their susceptibility to specific warheads can be specified as follows:</p>

			<li>1% means no retaliate, no passive acquire</li>

		<h4>Immunities</h4>
		<p>The original game has a way to make certain units immune to certain warheads, however this is severely limited. For example, the <code>[DESO]</code> infantry has the flag <code>ImmuneToRadiation=yes</code> and the <code>[RadBeamWarhead]</code> warhead has the flag <code>Radiation=yes</code>. This means that the Desolator is immune to damage from the radiation beams fired by other Desolators. This immunity system has 2 limitations:</p>
		<ul class="nobullets">
			<li>1. Only a small handful of working flag pairs exist, and</li>
			<li>2. The immunity only prevents the unit from taking damage from the warhead. It does not prevent the unit from being targeted. In the above example, Desolators can fire at each other ineffectually.
		</ul>
		<p><span class="gamename">Ares</span> overcomes these limitations with new armor types, as mentioned above. If you want to have additional 'old-style' immunities that still allow units to target things they can't damage (e.g. because they will affect enemies in an area around the target) then you can create a new armor type that will emulate this as follows:</p>
		<pre>	[ArmorTypes]
	flakImmuneToFrost=flak
		
	[IceMan]
	Armor=flakImmuneToFrost
	Primary=IceBlast
		
	[IceBlast]
	Warhead=IceBlastWH
		
	[IceBlastWH]
	Versus.flakImmuneToFrost=0%
	Versus.flakImmuneToFrost.ForceFire=yes
	Versus.flakImmuneToFrost.Retaliate=yes
	Versus.flakImmuneToFrost.PassiveAcquire=yes</pre>
		<p>The above settings give the IceMan unit a damage immunity to the IceMan weapon, even though he can still be attacked by that weapon.</p>

		<h3>MakeInfantryOwner</h3>
		<p>The original <code>MakeInfantry</code> logic would always grant ownership of newly-created infantry to the neutral side, unless the animation was caused by an <span class="type">InfantryType</span> being killed by an <code>InfDeath=9</code> warhead (in which case the killing player would get ownership of the new InfantryType). <span class="gamename">Ares</span> lets you choose which player will gain ownership, from one of several options.</p>

	<h3>Super Weapons</h3>
	<p>In <span class="gamename">Yuri's Revenge</span>, there is very little you can do to change or add to the existing super weapons &ndash; most super weapon-related features are hard-coded to only work as designed for the original super weapons. <span class="gamename">Ares</span>, however, includes several new ways to customize existing super weapons as well as several wholly new super weapons.<dfn class="new">Super Weapons:</dfn></p>
	<p><span class="note">NB: You cannot change a super weapon's <code>Type=</code> or <code>Action=</code> values in any of the game mode specific INI files (like <span class="filename">mpfreeforallmd.ini</span>) or map files.

		<h4>Building Animations</h4>
		<p>Buildings can display specific animations for when the attached super weapon is charging, is nearly charged (1 minute remaining in the normal game), is ready to be fired, and when it fires.

		</dl>
		<p><strong>Other changes:</strong></p>
		<p>It is now possible to chronoshift buildings. Note that there is a difference to chronoporting units: If a building cannot be placed in the target location it will blow up in the source location (if the default <code>Chronosphere.BlowUnplaceable=yes</code> is used). Vehicle-type buildings will try to find a fitting place just like units would.</p>
		<p>See <a href="#Chronoshift">Chronoshift</a> to prevent objects from being chronoshifted.</p>
		<p><span class="note">NB: There are several known issues with chronoshifting buildings that haven't been fixed yet. For example, buildup animations will restart and the turret facing is reset.</span></p>

		<p>The original flags that control the units provided by the generic paradrop super weapons (<code>AllyParaDropInf</code>, <code>SovParaDropInf</code> and <code>YuriParaDropInf</code>) and the American paradrop (<code>AmerParaDropInf</code>) only accept InfantryTypes. If you try to include a <span class="type">VehicleType</span> via these lists then the game will create a new <span class="type">InfantryType</span> instead - with the same parameters as the existing <span class="type">VehicleType</span> - ultimately resulting in an invisible <span class="type">InfantryType</span> being delivered in the paradrop.</p>
		<p>With <span class="gamename">Ares</span>, there are new country-specific flags that override the old flags and enhance the way paradrops are delivered. <code>ParaDrop.Types</code> will accept <span class="type">VehicleTypes</span> as well as <span class="type">InfantryTypes</span>.

		<p>You can define every plane for each country, side or the super weapon separately. The syntax is as follows:<br><code>[Superweapon]&#9658;Paradrop.<em>ID</em>.Plane<em>X</em>.*=</code><br><em>ID</em> is name of the country or side. <em>X</em> is a positive integer, with no leading zeros, starting with <em>2</em> up to <code>Count</code>.

		<h5><code>Type=Firestorm</code></h5>
		<p>
			This superweapon is a recreation of the <span class="gamename">Tiberian Sun</span> Firestorm superweapon.<br>
			When activated, all structures owned by the firing player that have <code>Firestorm.Wall=yes</code> set will emit an energy field, blocking all hostile projectiles (except those with <code>SubjectToFirestorm=no</code> set) from passing through. The energy field also destroys any friend or foe unlucky (or stupid) enough to come into direct contact with active cells.<br>
			<br>
			BuildingTypes with <code>Firestorm.Wall=yes</code> set will act as a section of the Firestorm Wall and auto-connect to other nearby pieces (check the original building's SHP from <span class="gamename">Tiberian Sun</span> to see how the art is controlled).<br>
			<br>
			This Superweapon uses the old Charge-Drain logic: once activated, the effect will persist for a duration determined by <code>[General]&#9658;ChargeToDrainRatio</code>, after which it will automatically shut down and the superweapon will restart its charging process. Whilst the effect is active you can click the super weapon button again to manually deactivate it, thus allowing the recharge process to begin earlier and finish faster. Refer to <a href="http://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ChargeToDrainRatio">ModEnc</a> for more information about Charge-Drain logic.<br>
			<br>
			In <span class="gamename">Tiberian Sun</span>, the Charge-Drain feature was disableable through an INI flag (<code>[SuperWeapon]&#9658;UseChargeDrain=no</code>) however: <span class="gamename">Ares</span> forces this logic to be used regardless of the value of that flag. <span class="gamename">Ares</span> also forces this super weapon to ignore its assigned <code>Action</code>, if any, as this is required to make it activate from a single click of the sidebar icon.<br>
			<br>
			The AI will not use this super weapon.<br>
			<span class="note">NB: The animations used by this logic are temporarily hard-coded to "FSIDLE", "FSGRND" and "FSAIR", as was used in <span class="gamename">Tiberian Sun</span>.</span><br>

			<dd>Determines the percent chance that each of the unit's passengers (if any) will survive. Rookie/Veteran/Elite refers to the veteran level of the transport unit &ndash; a unit with a higher veteran level could be made to have a greater (or lesser) chance of allowing its passengers to survive.

		</dl>
		<p>These flags default to a special-case value of -1 which means "use the original game logic" (i.e. land-based vehicles such as the Battle Fortress will eject their passengers but jumpjet vehicles such as the Nighthawk will not).<br>
		Note that, for airborne vehicles such as the Nighthawk, there is no way to say "passengers can survive on the ground, but aren't allowed to paradrop from the air" &ndash; if they can survive they can survive.</p>
		<p>If either the pilots or any passengers are 'killed' because they were not spawned (i.e. because the ground was not clear or the random chance did not luck in) then they count as having been killed by the unit that killed the transport. If <code>Survivor.PilotChance=0</code> then the pilots will not count as having been killed (however, passengers will always count as having been killed, even if <code>Survivor.PassengerChance=0</code>).</p>
		<p>Spawned pilots will be spawned with 50% of their maximum health and the same amount of experience as the destroyed unit had. Passengers will emerge with both their health and their experience unchanged.<dfn class="new">Percent chance for pilots and/or passengers to emerge/parachute from destroyed vehicles/aircraft.</dfn></p>

		<p>BuildingTypes without their Operator will not be able to fire their weapon, if they have one.</p>
		<p>No other building-specific functions will be affected (e.g. providing power, being a factory, undeploying, super weapons, radar, etc).</p>

		<h3>Urban Combat &ndash; Trenches</h3>
		<p>This section covers several new features that were designed together in order to allow mod authors to add occupiable trenches to the game.<br>
		These features do not all have to be used together to implement trenches though - each feature has been designed to be customizable and can be used separately.<br>
		<span class="note">NB: This means that these individual features do not distinguish between buildings that are a trench and buildings that are not. It is important that you understand how each new flag works - both on its own and in conjunction with other trench-related flags.</span><dfn class="new">Numerous features added to support trenches:</dfn></p>
	
		<h4>Pass Through</h4>
		<p>Urban Combat buildings can now specify what percentage of attacks against them will 'pass through' to the occupants inside &ndash; damaging them rather than the building itself.<dfn class="new">Weapons can be made to pass through urban combat buildings to the occupants inside (including fatal chance and damage modifier).</dfn></p>
		<dl class="flaglist">
			<dt>[BuildingType]&#9658;UC.PassThrough= (float - chance)</dt>
			<dd>The percentage of shots that will pass through to the occupants (and therefore not damage this building). Defaults to zero percent (i.e. all shots damage the building / no shots damage the occupants). When there are no occupants inside then <code>UC.PassThrough</code> will be ignored (i.e. all shots damage the building).<var class="rules BuildingType float_-_chance">UC.PassThrough=</var></dd>
			<dt>[BuildingType]&#9658;UC.FatalRate= (float - chance)</dt>
			<dd>In the event that a shot has passed through, the percentage of those shots that will instantly kill one occupant, disregarding the weapon entirely. Defaults to zero percent.<var class="rules BuildingType float_-_chance">UC.FatalRate=</var></dd>
			<dt>[BuildingType]&#9658;UC.DamageMultiplier= (float - multiplier)</dt>
			<dd>If a shot has passed through but isn't necessarily fatal then one occupant will be damaged. The damage dealt by the weapon will be multiplied by <code>UC.DamageMultiplier</code>. Defaults to 100% (i.e. no change to the damage dealt by the weapon).<var class="rules BuildingType float_-_multiplier">UC.DamageMultiplier=</var></dd>
			<dt>[Projectile]&#9658;SubjectToTrenches= (boolean)</dt>
			<dd>Whether or not this projectile will override the normal <code>UC.PassThrough</code> chance on targeted buildings. If the projectile has <code>SubjectToTrenches=no</code> set, and the target building has UC.PassThrough set greater than zero, then the building will be treated as if it had <code>UC.PassThrough=100%</code>, when hit by this projectile. If <code>SubjectToTrenches=yes</code> is set (default), then the normal <code>UC.PassThrough</code> chance will be used when the building is hit by this projectile.<var class="rules Projectile boolean no">SubjectToTrenches=</var></dd>
		</dl>
		<p>SubjectToTrenches was very much intended for trenches - a Grenadier, for example, would easily be able to drop their grenade into an open trench and would therefore definitely harm the occupants.<br>
		<span class="note">NB: The name 'SubjectToTrenches' is misleading if you are not thinking about trenches. This has an effect on all occupiable buildings with UC.PassThrough > 0%.</span></p>

			<img style="border-width: 3px;" src="./manual_images/subjecttotrenches_passthrough.png" alt="Illustration of different UC.PassThrough values">
		</p>

		<h4>Squatters' Rights</h4>
		<p>You can now specify that Battle Bunkers, for example, can be captured by enemy infantry just by having them walk in and garrison the building as if it were their own.</p>
		<dl class="flaglist">
			<dt>[BuildingType]&#9658;Bunker.Raidable= (boolean)</dt>
			<dd>Whether or not this building can be garrisoned by an enemy player's infantry, provided the building is not already occupied.<var class="rules BuildingType boolean no">Bunker.Raidable=</var></dd>
		</dl>
		<p>If <code>Bunker.Raidable=yes</code> is set and the building is empty then the building can be garrisoned by any player's infantry. When another player garrisons the building, ownership is transferred to that player. At this point the building can only be further garrisoned by the player whose troops are inside. If the occupants leave the building then ownership of the building is transferred back to its original owner. Whilst a building is held by a player that is not the "true" owner, that building cannot be sold.<dfn class="new">Unoccupied player buildings can be garrisoned by enemy infantry.</dfn></p>

		<h4>Advanced Rubble</h4>
		<p>If you really hit a trench hard enough to destroy it you're only doing one of two things; either you're turning a small hole into a larger hole, or you're making it collapse. Either way, you don't really remove the trench from the battlefield - just render it unusable. It will be easier to re-dig a trench there than on untouched soil, and, on the other hand, you can't just build there like nothing ever happened.<dfn class="new">Buildings can be converted into a different building on destruction (rubble) and back again on repair by an engineer.</dfn></p>
		<p>Advanced Rubble is implemented in a similar way to other upgrade systems in <span class="gamename">Ares</span>:</p>
		<dl class="flaglist">
			<dt>[BuildingType]&#9658;Rubble.Destroyed= (BuildingType)</dt>
			<dd>The new <span class="type">BuildingType</span> that this <span class="type">BuildingType</span> will transform into upon destruction. Buildings that are created via <code>Rubble.Destroyed</code> will have the following properties forced upon them:
			<pre>Capturable=no
TogglePower=no
Unsellable=yes
CanBeOccupied=no</pre>
			The building will be created with maximum <code>Strength</code>. Engineers will always get a repair cursor over the building.<var class="rules BuildingType">Rubble.Destroyed=</var></dd>
			<dt>[BuildingType]&#9658;Rubble.Intact= (BuildingType)</dt>
			<dd>The new <span class="type">BuildingType</span> that this <span class="type">BuildingType</span> will transform into when it is repaired. The repaired building will be created with 1% <code>Strength</code>.<var class="rules BuildingType">Rubble.Intact=</var></dd>
		</dl>
		<p>Note that Engineers will not be 'used up' by this repair process - they keep existing outside of the trench. This is very much intended for trenches: an Engineer would not be repairing/rebuilding an entire building, just re-digging a trench so his work would not be too exhausting.</p>
		<span class="note">NB: <span class="gamename">Ares</span> enforces the foundations of <code>Rubble.Destroyed=</code> and <code>Rubble.Intact=</code> to match those of the original <span class="type">BuildingType</span>. Custom foundations never match built-in foundations. A fatal error will be raised if you do not comply with this requirement and the game will exit.</span></p>

		<h4>Traversing Trenches</h4>
		<p>A major concept of trenches is the ability for infantry to move from one segment of a trench to the next, on the basis that adjacent segments are connected and, in essence, the same trench.</p>
		<dl class="flaglist">
			<dt>[BuildingType]&#9658;IsTrench= (string - trench type ID)</dt>
			<dd>Specifies a unique name for this particular trench so that the game knows that it is a trench for traversal purposes, and allows occupants to transfer between segments of the same trench type.<var class="rules BuildingType string_-_trench_type_ID">IsTrench=</var></dd>
		</dl>
		<p>For example, let's say you have <code>IsTrench=AlliedModern</code>. You have 2 segments of this trench adjacent to one another and one of these segments is garrisoned. If you select the garrisoned segment and then position the mouse cursor over the adjacent segment, you will get an 'enter' cursor over the adjacent segment. Clicking now with the enter cursor showing will transfer the occupants from the garrisoned segment into the adjacent segment.<br>
		<span class="note">NB: There is no special image-handling with IsTrench logic (yet); you will not get nice rows of trenches with proper joins/closed off ends like you do with, say, walls or Laser Fences.</span><dfn class="new">Infantry can jump from one urban combat building to an adjacent one.</dfn></p>

		<h3>Custom Building Foundations</h3>
		<p>Building Foundations can now be any shape and size, not just the few predefined options previously available. For example, you can now recreate the old Red Alert Repair Depot foundation. The INI coding is rather complex, so instead of writing it manually, it's recommended to use the <a href="custom_foundation.html">Custom Foundation Generator</a> developed by Renegade.</p>
		<p>When creating foundations, don't forget to create the outlines.</p>
		<p><span class="note">NB: War Factories are hard-coded to use the unit exit paths from the original game so changing the foundation for these buildings is not recommended. The preferred exit point for a unit exiting a War Factory is hard-coded to be the 11th cell of the Outline.</span> <dfn class="new">Buildings can have any size and shape of custom foundations.</dfn></p>

				This works in the same way as the old <code>PrismSupportModifier</code> - it is the amount of multiplier that this tower will contribute to the firing beam. The multiplier accumulates in a linear fashion (i.e. if there are 2 support towers, each with <code>PrismForwarding.SupportModifier=150%</code>, then the total multiplier to damage will be <tt>150% + 150% + 100% = 400%</tt>.

				A flat damage bonus added to the firing beam before the <code>SupportModifier</code> multiplier is applied.

				Whether or not this Prism Tower can abort supporting another tower at the last moment, in order to become a master (firing) tower instead. If a tower does break support, it does not need to restart charging. Defaults to no.
				<var class="rules BuildingType boolean no">PrismForwarding.BreakSupport=</var>
			</dd>
			<dt>[BuildingType]&#9658;PrismForwarding.ChargeDelay= (integer - frames)</dt>
			<dd>
				<p><em class="red">This is for advanced users only!</em> This option was only really added for testing purposes and doesn't really enhance the look of the support beam so it is recommended that you ignore this option.<br>
				In the original game, the master (firing) tower enlists just one slave (support) tower per frame. Each slave tower enlisted begins charging at that time and the master tower restarts charging. This gives the effect of having the slave tower beams arrive in quick succession, rather than all at once. This effect is barely noticeable in-game except at slow speeds or if the network has a large number of towers.
				In <span class="gamename">Ares</span>, this has been changed so that all adjacent slave towers are enlisted on the same frame. That said, a charge delay has been introduced so that the towers do not all appear to start charging immediately. For each backward-chain in the network, the farthest-forward towers begin charging just that little bit later, to give the effect of the beam travelling along the chain. The amount that each tower will delay starting it's charge for can be specified by <code>PrismForwarding.ChargeDelay</code>. This delay accumulates for each chain in the prism forwarding network. So, for example, if <code>PrismForwarding.ChargeDelay=2</code> and you have a prism chain of 3 towers then the farthest tower (tower 3) will begin charging immediately, the middle tower (tower 2) will begin charging after 2 frames and the firing tower (tower 1) will begin charging after a further 2 frames. All towers will be in their charging state on the 4th frame. At firing time, the beams will filter down from the farthest tower to the firing tower.<br>
				Due to the new way in which the actual power of the beam is transferred across the prism forwarding network, the minimum <code>ChargeDelay</code> is 1, so you cannot have the beams all appear simultaneously. However, at normal game speeds, a <code>ChargeDelay</code> of 1 frame is barely noticeable, unless there is a particularly long chain in the network.<br>
				Default charge delay is 1. Increase this to have the support beams spread across the network more slowly (not recommended, as large values tend to lower the quality of the effect).
				<var class="rules BuildingType integer_-_frames 1">PrismForwarding.ChargeDelay=</var>
			</dd>
			<dt>[BuildingType]&#9658;PrismForwarding.Intensity= (integer - laser thickness)</dt>
			<dd>
				This allows you to control how thick the laser beam grows as the size of the prism network increases. By default, a firing Prism Tower that is supported by 1 or more other towers would have a <code>LaserThickness</code> of 5 - that's 2 higher than the default <code>LaserThickness</code> of the firing weapon (3). The <Code>PrismForwarding.Intensity</code> flag treats negative values as an absolute addition to the firing beam, so the default value of -2 leaves the behaviour exactly the same as the original game.<br>
				Postive values, on the other hand, tell <span class="gamename">Ares</span> that you want the thickness of the beam to be dependent on the number of backward chains in the network, <i>and also have the support beam thickness increase in the same way</i>. A <code>PrismForwarding.Intensity</code> value of 1 would cause the farthest beam to have no thickness increase, the next to have an increase of 1, the next to have an increase of 2, and so on. See the section on <code>LaserThickness</code> for more information regarding the way lasers are drawn.
				<var class="rules BuildingType integer_-_laser_thickness -2">PrismForwarding.Intensity=</var>
			</dd>
			<dt>[BuildingType]&#9658;Overpowerable= (boolean)</dt>
			<dd>
				In the original game, a firing Prism Tower always fires its Primary weapon (whose damage is multiplied based on the number of supporting towers). The <code>Overpowerable</code> flag was ignored. <span class="gamename">Ares</span> allows firing Prism Towers to make use of the overpower logic - you can now have a supported & overpowered Prism Tower at the same time! Note that overpowering a support tower will not have any effect.
			</dd>
			<dt>[BuildingType]&#9658;PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon= (weapon)</dt>
			<dd>
				In the original game, the <code>[PrismSupport]</code> weapon was never referenced directly, and the <code>Secondary</code> weapon of the Prism Tower was only ever referenced to get the <code>Range</code> that towers could support over.<br>
				In <span class="gamename">Ares</span>, the <code>Secondary</code> weapon of the Prism Tower is not referenced <i>at all</i>. Instead, we use <code>PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon</code> to explicitly reference a weapon object from which to get additional settings for the support beam.<br>
				<var class="rules BuildingType weapon">PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon=</var>
				It isn't necessary to specify a support weapon - default values will be used if you don't specify one.<br>
			</dd>
			<dt>[BuildingType]&#9658;PrismForwarding.EliteSupportWeapon= (weapon)</dt>
			<dd>
				If the tower becomes elite then the support beam will get its properties from this weapon. Defaults to <code>PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon</code>.

		<h4>Customizing The Support Beam</h4>
		<p>The <code>PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon</code> is <i>not</i> a weapon in the traditional sense and does not actually get fired. Only specific properties of the weapon are used by the Prism Forwarding system, and these are all described below. Note that the default values mentioned are <span class="note"><b>only</b></span> used in the event that you have not specified a support weapon. If you <i>have</i> specified a support weapon, then <i>the default values are the same as for any other weapon</i>.<br>
		It is <i>not</i> recommended to use the existing <code>[PrismSupport]</code> weapon as a base. If you want to customize the default values then you should use the provided example at the end of the following flag list instead.</p>
		<dl class="flaglist">
			<dt>[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]&#9658;Range= (integer - cells)</dt>
			<dd>
				Specifies the maximum range over which the Prism Tower can support another. This does not affect the final firing range. -2 means infinite range.<br>
				If no support weapon is specified then the default support range is the tower's <code>Primary</code> weapon range plus 1 cell (the extra cell ensures that placing a support tower within the attack radius circle of a firing tower guarantees that the support tower is within support range). <i>This is different to the original game.</i>
			</dd>
			<dt>[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]&#9658;MinimumRange= (integer - cells)</dt>
			<dd>
				Specifies the minimum range at which the Prism Tower can support another. This Prism Tower will not be able to support towers that are closer than <code>MinimumRange</code>.<br>
				If no support weapon is specified then there is no minimum support range by default.
			</dd>
			<dt>[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]&#9658;ROF= (integer - frames)</dt>
			<dd>
				After a support tower has fired a support beam, it will be unable to fire at a target or support another Prism Tower for this many frames.<br>
				If no support weapon is specified then the default duration is <code>[General]&#9658;PrismSupportDelay</code>.
			</dd>
			<dt>[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]&#9658;Report= (sound)</dt>
			<dd>
				The sound to play when a Prism Tower fires a support beam. In the original game, the support beams did not cause a firing sound to be played. Note that lots of Prism Towers firing support beams at once may result in an annoying repetition or loud volume, so you may want to limit the number of instances of the sound and/or use a quieter or more subtle sound.<br>
				If no support weapon is specified then there is no firing sound for the support beam by default.
			</dd>
			<dt>[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]&#9658;IsLaser= (boolean)</dt>
			<dd>
				Specifies whether or not a laser beam should be drawn when supporting another tower. The other laser controls (<code>LaserDuration</code>, <code>IsHouseColor</code>, <code>LaserInnerColor</code>, <code>LaserOuterColor</code>, <code>LaserOuterSpread</code> and <code>LaserThickness</code>) are also respected.<br>
				If no support weapon is specified then the traditional support laser will be drawn (<code>IsLaser=yes</code>, <code>LaserDuration=[General]&#9658;PrismSupportDuration</code>, <code>IsHouseColor=yes</code>, <code>LaserThickness=3</code>)
			</dd>
			<dt>[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]&#9658;IsElectricBolt= (boolean)</dt>
			<dd>
				Specifies whether or not an electric bolt should be drawn when supporting another tower. The other electric bolt controls (<code>IsAlternateColor</code>, <code>Bolt.Color1</code>, <code>Bolt.Color2</code> and <code>Bolt.Color3</code>) are also respected.<br>
				If no support weapon is specified then no electric bolt will be drawn.
			</dd>
			<dt>[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]&#9658;IsRadBeam= (boolean)</dt>
			<dd>
				Specifies whether or not a rad beam should be drawn when supporting another tower. The other rad beam controls (<code>Beam.Duration</code>, <code>Beam.IsHouseColor</code>, <code>Beam.Color</code> and <code>Beam.Amplitude</code>) are also respected.<br>
				If no support weapon is specified then no rad beam will be drawn.
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>No other properties of the support weapon are referenced at present, however this could be changed in the future.</p>
		<p>Example support weapon:
		<pre>
		[NewPrismSupportBeam]
		Range=9 ;or 8 if you prefer the original
		ROF=45
		IsLaser=yes
		IsHouseColor=yes
		LaserDuration=15
		LaserThickness=3
		</pre>
		</p>
		<h4>Support Beam FLH</h4>
		<p>The firing origing of the support beam can be set by using the FLH controls on the buliding's art entry - <code>AlternateFLH0</code> specifies the rookie support beam origin, <code>AlternateFLH1</code> specifies the elite support beam origin. If either of these are set to 0,0,0 (the default FLH value) then they will fall back to using <code>PrimaryFireFLH</code> or <code>ElitePrimaryFireFLH</code>, as appropriate.</p>
		<h4>Prism Tower Limitations</h4>
		<p>Prism Towers should not be allowed to undeploy - undeploying a Prism Tower during a charge sequence can cause an Internal Error.</p>

	<h3>Miscellaneous Modding Enhancements</h3>
	<p>All the changes/additions that make various tasks easier for the mod author, but don't directly provide any new functionality.</p>
	
	<div class="ares01">
		<h3>[#include]</h3>
		<p><span class="gamename">Ares</span> allows you to split your <span class="filename">rulesmd.ini</span> file up into separate pieces so as to better organise the various settings. Any INI files you list under the new <code>[#include]</code> section will be loaded once the main file itself has finished loading. INI files included in this manner can also specify their own <code>[#include]</code> section to load further INIs. There is no depth limit, and the file loading recursion is depth-first (In English: if the original INI file includes multiple files, and an included file includes other files itself, those second-level files will be included before resuming inclusion of the remaining first-level ones. Recurse again if necessary.)</p>
		<p>For example, the <code>[#include]</code> section you specify in <span class="filename">rulesmd.ini</span> may look something like this:</p>
		<pre>[#include]
1=rules_sw.ini
2=rules_vehicles.ini
3=rules_buildings.ini
4=rules_aircraft.ini
5=rules_infantry.ini</pre>
		<p>As each INI file is loaded, any flag that is encountered that has already been defined will have its value updated with the newly found value. Using the above include list as an example, if <code>[E1]&#9658;Strength=200</code> is specified in <span class="filename">rulesmd.ini</span>, and <code>[E1]&#9658;Strength=300</code> is specified in <span class="filename">rules_infantry.ini</span>, then the GI will have <code>Strength=300</code> in-game.</p>
	
		<p>INI files are taken to be relative to the <span class="gamename">Red Alert 2</span> directory. Values in the include list can include subfolders (e.g. <code>5=MyMod\rules_infantry.ini</code>). The currently loaded MIXes are also scanned for the files if a loose file of that name cannot be found, however, this only works if you do not specify a subfolder.<dfn class="new"><code>[#include]</code> section allows <span class="filename">rulesmd.ini</span> to be split up into separate files.</dfn><var class="rules">#include</var></p>

		<p>It is also now possible to name objects in INI code (without having to create a string table entry) by using the <code>NOSTR:</code> prefix.

		<h3>Internal Errors / Debugging</h3>
		<p>When an Internal Error occurs, the <span class="filename">except.txt</span> file that is produced has been modified so as to output more information that is both relevant to mod authors, and also relevant to us, the developers, when debugging the changes and additions introduced by <span class="gamename">Ares</span>.</p>
		<p><span class="filename">except.txt</span> may include a timestamp in the filename to prevent an existing <span class="filename">except.txt</span> file being overwritten.</p>
		<p><span class="gamename">Ares</span> will give you the option to produce a crash dump file to assist in determining the cause of the error. This file will be stored in a Debug folder within the main game directory. Note that the crash dump file is very large and may only be readable by the <span class="gamename">Ares</span> developers. Like <span class="filename">except.txt</span>, this file will include a timestamp in the filename.</p>
		<p>If you have turned on debug logging (see <a href="#CommandLineArguments">Command Line Arguments</a> and <a href="#DebugLogging">Debug Logging</a>) then the game will produce a debug.log file in the aforementioned Debug folder. Like <span class="filename">except.txt</span>, this file will include a timestamp in the filename. The log file may contain useful information for helping diagnose problems with your mod or <span class="gamename">Ares</span> itself.</p>
		<p>In the event of an Internal Error, <span class="gamename">Ares</span> can sometimes tell you what caused the error. For example:</p>

		<h3>Campaign List</h3>
		<p>If you have more campaigns than the game's default Campaign Selection menu supports you can switch to a campaign list as in <span class="gamename">Tiberian Sun</span>. Ares supports an arbitrary amout of campaigns. Every non-debug battle listed in <span class="filename">battlemd.ini</span> will show up in the list under the name defined by <code>Description=</code>. <dfn class="new">Campaign List.</dfn></p>
		<p class="center"><img src="./manual_images/ui_campaignlist.jpg" alt="Campaign list showing both original campaigns with summary"></p>
		<p>Enable the campaign list in <span class="filename">uimd.ini</span>:</p>
		<dl class="flaglist">
			<dt>[UISettings]&#9658;CampaignList= (boolean)</dt>
			<dd>
				Enables the campaign list instead of the game's default menu.
				<var class="ui UISettings boolean no">CampaignList=</var>
			</dd>
			<dt>[UISettings]&#9658;ShowDebugCampaigns= (boolean)</dt>
			<dd>
				Also displays campaigns in the list that have <code>DebugOnly=yes</code> set.
				<var class="ui UISettings boolean no">ShowDebugCampaigns=</var>
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>You can customize the campaigns in the list by editing <span class="filename">battlemd.ini</span>:</p>
		<dl class="flaglist">
			<dt>[Battle]&#9658;HoverSound= (sound)</dt>
			<dd>
				The sound to be played when the player selects a campaign. This defaults to <code>AlliedCampaignSelect</code>, <code>SovietCampaignSelect</code>, and <code>BootCampSelect</code> for the original in-game campaigns. The selection menu plays them if the mouse hovers over the respective campaign's image.
				<var class="battle Battle sound Game_default">HoverSound=</var>
			</dd>
			<dt>[Battle]&#9658;Summary= (CSF label)</dt>
			<dd>

		<h3>Campaign Load Screen Text Color</h3>

		<h3>Graphics / Surface Drawing</h3>
		<p><em class="red">This is for advanced users only!</em> By default, most of the game's drawing surfaces are allocated in system memory, but two of them (frequently used destination buffers) default to GPU memory.<br> Techniques used by the game to draw images to the screen require the former ones to be copied to the latter ones, and this operation is fairly expensive. <span class="gamename">Ares</span> allows you to allocate those surfaces in system memory, which means the source to destination copying is almost free.</p>
		<p>In <span class="filename">ares.ini</span> you can add the following section:</p>
		<pre>[Graphics.Advanced]
		DirectX.Force= (hardware|emulation)
		Surface.$surface.Memory= (System|VRAM)
		Surface.$surface.Force3D= (true|false)</pre>
		<p>...where <span class="tt">$surface</span> is one of <span class="tt">Composite</span>, <span class="tt">Alternate</span>, <span class="tt">Hidden</span>, <span class="tt">Sidebar</span> or <span class="tt">Tile</span>.</p>
		<p><span class="note">NB: enabling Force3D forces Memory into VRAM mode.</span><br>
		<span class="note">NB: Ares.ini is not intended to be included or edited by mods, as this file may include various other settings in future that the end-user wishes to set themselves. Launch Base does not permit mods to include ares.ini, and also provides its own interface to allow the user to modify the above graphical settings.</span><dfn class="new">Graphics/Surface drawing options can be configured by the user (advanced users only).</dfn></p>

	<h2>Required Changes For Mods Using <span class="gamename">Ares</span></h2>
	<p>Unfortunately, <span class="gamename">Ares</span> will not simply "work" without changes to the original game files. The reason for this is that maintaining compatibility with the original game files whilst still offering the enhancements that are <span class="gamename">Ares</span>' raison d'être would make implementing <span class="gamename">Ares</span> features (both for us, the developers, and you, the mod author) considerably more complex, ultimately wasting time that would be better spent on other tasks.</p>
	<p>This section details the modifications you'll most likely need to make to ensure your mod does not receive any unexpected changes from simply being run whilst <span class="gamename">Ares</span> is active.</p>
	<p>In future these changes will be provided as extensions to the standard files that are included with the YR Unofficial 1.002 Mini-Patch Developer's Pack.</p>

	<h3>Special Thanks</h3>
	<h4>Westwood Studios</h4>
	<p>For creating this great game in the first place. Although you guys really should've fired half of your coding staff (out of a cannon, into the sun).</p>

	<h4>Marshall</h4>
	<p>For developing Launch Base and the YR Unofficial 1.002 Mini-Patch (UMP), whipping this documentation into shape and developing Ares' Prism Forwarding feature.</p>

	<h4>Renegade</h4>
	<p>For hosting <span class="gamename">Ares</span> itself, performing the duties of Project Manager, creating the HTML version of the <span class="gamename">Ares</span> manual and, of course, contributing code and helper tools.</p>

	<h4><span class="gamename">Ares</span> Testers</h4>
	<p>For devoting their free time to testing <span class="gamename">Ares</span> and giving us feedback - this enables us to make <span class="gamename">Yuri's Revenge</span> and <span class="gamename">Ares</span> even better.</p>
